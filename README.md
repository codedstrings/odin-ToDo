# Odin To-Do List Application

A simple and elegant To-Do List application built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. This project allows users to create multiple projects, manage tasks, set priorities, and track due dates.

## Features
- **Create and Manage Projects**: Users can create multiple projects, each with its own list of tasks.
- **Task Management**: Add, edit, and remove tasks with attributes such as title, description, due date, and priority.
- **Dynamic UI**: Responsive interface that displays tasks by project, with different colors for priorities.
- **Modular Design**: Classes and functions are separated into different modules, keeping the code clean and maintainable.
  
## What I Learned

### Building from Scratch, No Frameworks
While a to-do list application is often seen as a basic and clich√© project, this experience was invaluable because I built it **without using any frameworks**. By relying solely on vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I gained a deeper understanding of:
- **DOM Manipulation**: Handling user interactions and updating the UI manually without the convenience of frameworks helped me learn what goes on under the hood of a framework.
- **Project Structure**: Organizing code into classes and modules, ensuring maintainability and scalability.
- **Advanced css concepts**: By building the UI from scratch without using any templates or frameworks, I learned advanced CSS concepts like Flexbox and Grid, which helped me create a responsive and well-structured layout for the application.: 

### SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class and module has a single responsibility, making the code easier to manage and extend.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: The code is open for extension but closed for modification, allowing new features to be added without altering existing functionality.

### Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript
- **Classes and Modules**: I learned how to create and manage multiple classes in separate modules, improving code organization.
- **Constructors**: Utilized constructors to initialize objects and understand how they work in JavaScript to create reusable task instances.

### Separation of Concerns
- **UI vs. Logic**: I split the application logic (task management, project handling) from the user interface, adhering to best practices in code separation. This makes the code more scalable and easier to maintain.
